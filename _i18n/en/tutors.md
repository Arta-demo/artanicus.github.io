New agents are encouraged to contact other local players. The players listed here have agreed to especially help new players get into the game and that newcomers in their area can contact them, as long as they are polite :) Use the faction COMM in the game or reach them through our G+-community.

Again, even if no-one is listed for your area, all older agents are glad to help newcomers. Get in touch.
