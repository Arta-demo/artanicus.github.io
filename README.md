Built with jekyll but you can write all content in pure html or Markdown.
All changes are made to the build branch, master is the currently published website.

To get started adding content, look at the .html files in the top directory and content under the _i18n directory.
Since the site is in two languages, most of the content is under _i18n/ and if unsure, you're pull request should contain at least one file under _i18n/, 
or preferably two if you can make both language versions at the same time.
